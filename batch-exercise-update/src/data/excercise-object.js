Compound exercises are exercises that work the muscles of two or more joints in your body. Basically, multiple muscles work together to perform a movement. This approach is effective because you can train more than one muscle at the same time. Doing compound exercises is more beneficial than isolation exercises. With compound movements, more muscle is used, which means more energy is spent and ultimately more fat is burned."],"img":{"href":"https://fitnessprogramer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bicycle-Crunch.gif","alt":"Bicycle Crunch"},"pMuscleGroup":["Abs","Cardio"],"equipment":["Full Gym","NO EQUIPMENT"],"targetMuscle":[{"name":"Target -  Obliques","percentage":"100"},{"name":"Rectus Abdominis","percentage":"80"},{"name":"Iliopsoas","percentage":"80"},{"name":"Quadriceps","percentage":"80"},{"name":"Tensor Fasciae Latae","percentage":"70"},{"name":"Sartorius","percentage":"80"}],"targetMuscleImg":{"src":"https://fitnessprogramer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Muscles-Worked-in-The-Bicycle-Crunch-300x300.png","alt":"Muscles Worked in The Bicycle Crunch","title":"Bicycle Crunch 2"}},{"eID":"15603","pageTitle":"Bicycle Twisting Crunch","pageSubTitle":"Exercise / Abs","guide":[],"img":{"href":"https://fitnessprogramer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Bicycle-Twisting-Crunch.gif","alt":"Bicycle Twisting Crunch"},"pMuscleGroup":["Abs"],"equipment":["Full Gym","NO EQUIPMENT"],"targetMuscle":[]},{"eID":"9586","pageTitle":"Bike","pageSubTitle":"Exercise / Cardio","guide":[],"img":{"href":"https://fitnessprogramer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bike.gif","alt":"Bike"},"pMuscleGroup":["Cardio"],"equipment":["Full Gym","Machine"],"targetMuscle":[]},{"eID":"25343","pageTitle":"Bird Dog","pageSubTitle":"Exercise / Erector Spinae, Hip","guide":[],"img":{"href":"https://fitnessprogramer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bird-Dog.gif","alt":"Bird Dog"},"pMuscleGroup":["Erector Spinae","Hip"],"equipment":["Full Gym","NO EQUIPMENT"],"targetMuscle":[]},{"eID":"21236","pageTitle":"Bitilasana | Cow Pose","pageSubTitle":"Exercise / Yoga","guide":[],"img":{"href":"https://fitnessprogramer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bitilasana-Cow-Pose.gif","alt":"Bitilasana | Cow Pose"},"pMuscleGroup":["Yoga"],"equipment":["Full Gym","NO EQUIPMENT"],"targetMuscle":[]},{"eID":"15599","pageTitle":"Boat Pose","pageSubTitle":"Exercise / Abs, Leg","guide":[],"img":{"href":"https://fitnessprogramer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Boat-Pose-Stretch.gif","alt":"Boat Pose"},"pMuscleGroup":["Abs","Leg"],"equipment":["Full Gym","NO EQUIPMENT"],"targetMuscle":[]},{"eID":"9560","pageTitle":"Body Ups","pageSubTitle":"Exercise / Triceps","guide":["Body Ups is an compound triceps exercise that increases arm strength and develop arm muscles.
